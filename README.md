npm run dev:web
```

### Production

```

The application runs on port 3003 by default (configurable via PORT environment variable).

## Architecture

The application uses a modular architecture where each module (ecommerce, warehouse, delivery) is independently configurable but shares common services through the NooblyJS service registry. This allows for:

- **Scalability**: Each module can be scaled independently
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Flexibility**: Services can be swapped or extended easily
- **Integration**: Seamless data flow between modules
